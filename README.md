### MIT's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming

This repository provides full solutions to  [MIT's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python Course] (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/). I highly reccomend this course if you are starting out with Python as it really helps to build your confidence through practical problems which include using Python to build simple games, Monte Carlo methods to simulate drug dynamics in the human body and basic statistical models to find evidence of climate change in cities.
